I 
sail 
above 
the 
clouds
Gravity 
is 
no 
longer 
bound 
to 
me
All 
the 
airplanes 
seem 
steel 
kites
No 
fear 
of 
falling 
down
Nothing 
moves 
nothing 
makes 
a 
sound 
and
I'm 
still 
floating 
I 
see 
no
bounds
And
fate 
is 
coming 
into 
our 
lives
And 
we 
are 
waiting 
for 
the 
day
to 
come
Hate
is 
undermining 
into 
our 
bowels
To 
the 
right 
and 
to 
the 
left
Run
From 
a 
star 
to 
another 
one
Maybe 
in 
this 
way
The 
universe 
will 
never 
come 
to 
an 
end
And 
you
Can not
you 
see
me 
getting 
worked 
up
Yeah
you 
know 
I'm 
carrying 
an 
enormous 
love
Reaching 
outer 
space
The 
atmosphere 
burnt 
my 
face 
but
I
keep 
seeking
my 
astral 
way
Is 
this 
the 
right 
path
Do 
I 
have 
to 
go 
further
Going 
on 
wandering 
or 
going 
back 
home
And 
fate 
is
coming 
into 
our 
lives
And 
we 
are 
waiting 
for 
the 
day 
to 
come
Hate 
is 
undermining 
into 
our 
bowels
To 
the 
right 
and 
to 
the 
left
Run
From 
a 
star 
to 
another 
one
Maybe 
in 
this 
way
The 
universe 
will 
never 
come 
to 
an 
end
And 
you
Can not
you 
see 
me 
getting 
worked 
up
